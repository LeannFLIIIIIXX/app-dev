## My Favorite Series: Lucifer

Lucifer Morningstar, the Devil himself, has left Hell and is now running a nightclub in Los Angeles.  He's charming, witty, and incredibly handsome, but he's also bored with his immortal life.  When he meets LAPD detective Chloe Decker, he finds himself drawn to her and her world, leading him to use his supernatural abilities to help solve crimes.

**What I love about it:**

* **The characters:**  Lucifer is a complex and fascinating character, full of contradictions and surprising depth.  Chloe is a strong and independent woman who challenges Lucifer and helps him to grow.
* **The humor:**  The show is full of dark humor, witty banter, and clever dialogue.
* **The supernatural elements:**  Lucifer's powers and the world of angels and demons add a layer of intrigue and excitement to the show.
* **The romance:**  The chemistry between Lucifer and Chloe is undeniable, and their relationship is both playful and intense.

**You can watch it on:** Netflix
